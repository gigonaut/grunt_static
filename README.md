grunt_static
============

simple bare bones template for static things witht grunt. this is here more as an experiment at this point.

There are better scaffolding tools out there.  

With that being said, here is how it works:

The default task causes the dev build, so by typing:

```sh
grunt
```

you get the default dev build.

By typing:

```sh
grunt build
```

you get the distro build which doesn't really do much extra.

There is also a 
```sh
grunt watch
```
which keeps an eye on things while you work.
